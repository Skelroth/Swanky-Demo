I WANT new ideas, I WANT you to tell me what I have done incorrectly, I'm here to LEARN.

I understand that this is very alpha, it's my first major programming challenge and I hope to make it work for you all, the community.
Help me learn and understand features you want and need, help me learn to code more effectively, efficiently and secure.
