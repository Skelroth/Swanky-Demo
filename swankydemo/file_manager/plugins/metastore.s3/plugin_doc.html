<p>This plugin must be used only on a repository that uses the "access.s3" driver to store the files in AWS Simple Storage Service.
Metadata are then stored directly as a base64 encoded string in the S3 objects. The advantage of this method is that metadata will be
moved automatically along with the objects, as would the extended attributes of a file system, alleviating the software load.</p>
