<p>The default and basic "FileSystem" driver, used to browse, edit, manage, etc all documents contained on a local file system. The default repository bundled with AjaXplorer is using this driver.</p>
<p>FS Driver implements all the standard actions of AjaXplorer, including upload/download, moving the files in various ways. It registers the stream "ajxp.fs" in the application, that is able to read both local filesystem and zip archives (using PclZip included in the core).</p>
<p>Being the most standard access driver, it comes with an important set of options that can be configured either at  a plugin level ("Plugin parameters") or at a repository level ("Instance Parameters"). Please review them carefully, as many of the common usage problems can often be solved by tweaking these options.</p>
<p>Actions of this driver are not inside the manifest.xml (too big) but in a separate file, fsActions.xml. It's a good starting point to have a look at this file when you want to hack something in the application.</p>
