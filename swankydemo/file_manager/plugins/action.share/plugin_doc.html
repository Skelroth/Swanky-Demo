<p>This plugin gather both "share" actions (files sharing as temporary download links, and folder sharing as delegated repositories), as well as metadata hooks to display the share status of the files and folders inline. It is active only for stream provider drivers.</p>
<p>To make sure that the metadata appear correctly, make sure that the repositories implement one "metastore" plugin (only metastore.serial for the moment), as it is implementing the persistance of the metadata.</p>
