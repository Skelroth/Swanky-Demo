<p>Use Amazon Simple Storage S3 as a file container. This extension requires the following to be installed :
<ul>
    <li>PHP cURL extension</li>
    <li>PHP OpenSSL extension</li>
    <li>Amazon PHP Sdk : drop it inside the plugin, creating an aws-sdk/ folder (this folder must contain the sdk.class.php file)</li>
</ul>
        Once all this is installed, you should be able to access an S3 storage, using the API keys provided on your Amazon console.
