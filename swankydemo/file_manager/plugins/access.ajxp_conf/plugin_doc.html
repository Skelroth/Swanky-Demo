<p>This plugin is used natively by the application to browse and modify the application configuration data (via the "Settings" repository). Thus, it's a good example of how an access driver can browse some data totally different from a set of files : here the data is composed from various sources : application repositories, roles and user, application logs and diagnostic, etc. Data is still presented in a hierarchical view, making AjaXplorer totally suited to present and edit it.</p>
