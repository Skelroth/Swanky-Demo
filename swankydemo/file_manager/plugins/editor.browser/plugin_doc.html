<p>This editor will open any document in an external browser window. That way, if the browser supports a specific format that AjaXplorer does not support, this can be sometime handy.</p>
<p>Integration to the core of the previous <a href="http://www.ajaxplorer.info/wordpress/plugins/hook/openfile/">hook.openfile</a> plugin contributed by Zly.<br>
<br>
Will execute your browser-action for the specified filetype.&nbsp;For example, if you use a pdf reader plugin to open pdf files directly in you browser, this plugin will allow you to do the same when opening files in an AjaXplorer repository.<br>
<br>
It creates a new action in AjaXplorer called "Open file (in browser)".&nbsp;This action is available for all filetypes except folders.&nbsp;When you select a file, and execute this action, a new browser window (or tab) will be opened with the file you selected.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tested on<br>
</strong>Linux -&nbsp;Apache 2.X &amp; PHP 5.3.3&nbsp;- The plugin should work on all platforms and versions that AjaXplorer works on.&nbsp;Feel free to report in the associated thread if you use this plugin on a different setup than mine.<br>

Technical<br>
</strong>It sends (hopefully) the correct headers according to the selected file, in combination with the Content-Disposition: inline; header.&nbsp;This is done by guessing the mime-type in a 3-step cycle:<br>
<br>
. If the PECL fileinfo extension is available, the finfo class will be used to detect the mime-type.<br>
. Else if the (deprecated) mime_content_type function is available, it will be used.<br>
. Else if the file-extension is in the (included) mime.types file, the mime-type will be guessed by the file-extension.<br>
. If it is not possible to find a mime-type, the file is sent as application/octet-stream, and you browser will most likely open a download dialog.</p>
