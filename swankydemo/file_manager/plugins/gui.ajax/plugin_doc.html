<p>This is the default web interface displayed when accessing AjaXplorer via a browser. It's HTML5 compliant and powered
by the PrototypeJS library. The whole interface is built dynamically based on the various configurations gathered
through all the application plugins.</p>
<p>The interface is themeable, you create new theme by duplicating the folders below res/themes/. Theming should be
basically CSS tweaking. At the moment, "umbra" (latest) and "oxygen" (legacy) themes are bundled with the application, and
you can change the theme by accessing the plugin options.</p>
<p>Although not necessary, at the moment the other gui plugins rely on this one to load all the core JS classes and
bootstrap the AjaXplorer framework in the client.</p>
