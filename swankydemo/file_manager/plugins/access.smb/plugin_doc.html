<p>Connect a Samba share and browse its files and folders. This plugin is based on a php wrapper around the command line tool <b>smbclient</b>. This tool must be installed on the server and accessible in the machine path. If you want to manually set the path to the <b>smbclient</b> program, edit the plugin global configuration. Interestingly, there is a working alternative of smbclient installable on Windows, using Cygwin. See the detailed instructions <a href="http://www.citricity.com/moodlegpl/windowssharewebclient/instructions_for_installing_smbclient32_on_windows.pdf">here</a>. In that case, you may have to enter the full path to the smbclient via the plugin configuration.</p>
<p>For a repository, a typical configuration can be <ul><li>Host : <b>192.168.0.25</b></li><li>Uri : <b>Share</b></li></ul>If you encounter problems with "empty listing", check the ajaxplorer logs, and particularly set the server into debug mode : errors grabbed from the smbclient output are logged to the log file, not to the GUI, as sometimes it contains errors but sometimes it contains just warning or even info.</p>
<p>Like the ftp access driver with the auth.ftp, this smb driver can be used in conjunction with the auth.smb plugin to authenticate users directly against the samba share. </p><p>The SMB wrapper was first developped by Victor M. Varela.</p>
