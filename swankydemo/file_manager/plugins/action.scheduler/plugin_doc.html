    <p>This plugin replicates a CRONTAB-like scheduler that can register AjaXplorer actions to be triggered on a regular basis. It will be used in the future to register maintenance tasks like purging the caches, computing specific files processings in background, etc. It requires the activation of the command line access to the framework. Beware to check the correspondance between the apache and CLI versions of the php.ini, especially if you use exotic extensions or libraries.</p>
    <p>The scheduler itself must still be triggered externally, but this allows to register only one external call for starting the scheduler, and all actions can then be managed directly in AjaXplorer. The external call should be triggered through the command-line using the CLI version of the framework.</p>
   <p>Commands are programmed with a time expression similar to CRONTAB expression : for example, /5 * * * * would run a task every five minutes, or * 0 * * * every hour, etc. See Cron tutorials.</p>
