<p>This plugin computes and caches files signature in various formats to ease the task of external synchronisation tools. If the rsync PECL extension is found installed, it will also add actions to compute checksum / deltas and apply patches using the rdiff external commands, allowing to transfer files modifications with very low bandwith usage.</p>
