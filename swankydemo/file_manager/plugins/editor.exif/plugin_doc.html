<p>Display all available exif data for a JPG/Tiff picture.  This can only activated if you attach the meta.exif meta source to your repository. If GPS coordinates are found and editor.openlayer is active too, you have a button to switch to Google Map (or Open Street Map) and geolocalize your photo.</p>
<p>Warning, this relies on PHP « exif » extension, it must active in your PHP installation.</p>
