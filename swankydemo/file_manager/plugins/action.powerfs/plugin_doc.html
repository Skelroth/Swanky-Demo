<p>This plugin will delegate various time/memory-consuming actions to the underlying filesystem. <br><br>For the moment only the <b>ZIP delegation</b> is implemented. It requires the presence of the "zip" utilitary in the system path. Tested on both Linux and windows. If active, the "compress" action, as well as the "download folder" action, will trigger a background action monitoring the current percent of the ZIP operation. This allows the compression of huge amount of data.
