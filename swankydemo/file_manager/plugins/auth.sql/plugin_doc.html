<p>Stores the users data inside a database instead of a file. It is database generic, the connexion to the database must be described in an array, see http://dibiphp.com/cs/ for more info on databases supported and configurations. A create.sql file is included to generated the necessary table for storing users data.</p>

<p>This plugin can be useful as working base if your users are already stored in a database : digg the code and change it to the right table/columns. By default, the table is name "ajxp_users" with columns login and password.</p>

<p>
   The SQL_DRIVER option defined in the bootstrap_plugins.php file must be set with a "dibi" configuration that is PHP array like this :
    <pre>
    "SQL_DRIVER"	=> array(
        "driver" => "mysql",
        "host"   => "localhost",
        "database"   => "ajxp",
        "user"   => "user",
        "password"   => "pass",
    ),
    </pre>
</p>
