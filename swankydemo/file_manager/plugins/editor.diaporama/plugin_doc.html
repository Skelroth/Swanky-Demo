<p>The basic editor for standard web images types (jpg, gif, png). This editor handles a thumbnail preview, a metadata extraction for image mime type and dimension, and an online fullscreen view. Thumbnails are generated using the PThumb library (distributed with AjaXplorer).</p>

<p>The fullscreen viewer can be used as a diaporama with a variable auto-play timer. Zoom can be also set manually, and some parameters like "Fit Best" or "Actual Size" make this plugin really useful. Below is a sample screenshot.</p>

<p>The metadata associated with the image can also be displayed.
