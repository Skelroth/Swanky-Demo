|      AjaXplorer Quick Start                   |
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS & QUICK INSTALL
 
 To be able to run this system on your webserver, it must have PHP 5.3 or higher
 running, and you must have an FTP access to upload the files on the server. 
 Just make sure that the "data" folder is (recursively) writeable by the webserver.

 That's all! For the default configuration, no database is needed. But if you want to
 store data in a database, it's possible, see the *.sql plugins.

 2 CONFIGURATION

    The very basic configurations are to be found in the conf/ folder :

    + You should not have to tweak the bootstrap_context.php, unless you want to customize
      heavily your installation.
    + The bootstrap_repositories.php contains the default workspaces definition. The preferred
      way of creating new workspaces is by using the GUI (switch to the "Settings"), but you
      can also define them manually in this file if it's more handy for you

 2.1 WORKSPACES
    
    In AjaXplorer, a workspace is a folder that you want to browse/modify with
    the application. A workspace does not have to be inside the ajaxplorer installation
    folder, since you set it with an absolute path on your server.
    
    You can set as many workspaces as you want : you will be able to switch from one to
    another when logged to AjaXplorer, and you can precisely set rights for each users (see 
    paragraph 2.2) on each workspace.
    
    By default, the basic workspace is set to the "data/files" folder inside the ajaxplorer
    installation folder. You can change it to whatever you want, using absolute path 
    like : /home/login/www/location, or /C:/myfolder/ on windows.
    
    Note that a workspace does not have to be accessible to the internet, AjaXplorer will
    work as a "proxy" between your files and the web.
    
 2.2 USERS MANAGEMENT
    
    An evoluted users management system has been developed in AjaXplorer. You are encouraged 
    to use it to secure your data, but it's up to you, you can disable it totally (for example 
    if you are already working in a very secure zone, and don't need any users profiles).
    
    You can add / modify / delete users by logging in AjaXplorer as "admin" and switching to the
    "Settings" panel. For each user, you will be able to give read and/or right access separately
    on each workspace. Note that a user that has no rights on any workspace cannot log in.

    2.2.1 BASIC USERS CONFIGURATION
    	
    	ENABLE_USERS => 1 	Users management is enabled
    					0 	Users management is totally disabled. No logging required and all 
    						users share the same preferences.
    					
    	ALLOW_GUEST_BROWSING => 1 	In the "Settings" console accessed by admin user, 
    								a "guest" user is created on which you can set 
    								rights on workspaces like any other user. This
    								user will be automatically logged in if no user 
    								is identified.
    							0 	When no user is identified, the login screen appears 
    								and no workspace is loaded.

    				 			
 2.3 FURTHER CONFIGURATION   
 
	Switch to the "Settings" panel, and browse the various "Global Configurations" : particularly,
	you should have a look at the "Core" options, as well as the Plugins > Gui > Client Plugin (gui.ajax)
	where you can do some basic customization for your interface.
